# Get-ExcelFileVersion
The script Get-ExcelFileVersion.ps1 retrieves the version of an Excel file. The Microsoft Office applications were using binary file formats for a long time until Microsoft replaced them in Office 2007 with [XML-based file formats](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/open-xml-formats-and-file-name-extensions-5200d93c-3449-4380-8e11-31ef14555b18). The [Excel Binary File Formats](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_file_formats/ms-xls/cd03cb5f-ca02-4934-a391-bb674cb8aa06) are using in most cases the .XLS file extension but differ between versions despite the common file extension. For instance, the format of an Excel 2003 .xls file is different from the format of an Excel 95 .xls file. So it is not easy to make an inventory of the Excel files and the exact version in case you want to disable certain old file formats. Fortunately, the Excel object model provides the [XlFileFormat](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/excel.xlfileformat) enumeration that can be used to determine the exact file version. The script Get-ExcelFileVersion.ps1 takes advantage of this enumeration and displays the version for a specified Excel file.
